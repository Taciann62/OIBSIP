# Customer Segmentation Analysis


## Introduction

This data analytics project is completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte internship program (December Batch 2025).
The team provided the data through an open-source data platform, Kaggle. It contains a sales record of an Ecommerce store, alongside key fields such as Customer Gender, Product Name, Age, Product type, and the amount and Quantity purchased by each customer.

### Project Overview
The retail store collected a well-rounded dataset of its customers to get insight into their customer behaviour towards the products sold and, in that way, make a more informed business decision. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.
Through the analysis of this data, insights will also be provided into customer purchasing behaviour over the year 2023, with each month clearly represented.

## My Role
On this project, I assume the role of the data analyst to uncover these insights, provide recommendations that influence decision-making.
